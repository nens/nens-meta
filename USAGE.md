# N&S project setup usage

There is a small number of tools/addons you have to install. They'll make life easier in all projects with the new setup.


## One-time install: vscode plugins

- [Editorconfig plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig). This one automatically reads the config in the `.editorconfig` file and configures line length, an "enter" at the end of the file, indentation, unneeded spaces. No need to do anything by hand anymore.


## Other editors

- Most editors support [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) out of the box. Vscode and emacs need a plugin. The website has a list.
