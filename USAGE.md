# N&S project setup usage

There is a small number of tools/addons you have to install. They'll make life easier in all projects with the new setup.


## Install: vscode plugins

- **editorconfig** plugin. This one automatically reads the config in the `.editorconfig` file and configures line length, an "enter" at the end of the file, indentation, unneeded spaces. No need to do anything by hand anymore.
