# The various config files

## `.nens.toml`

## `.editorconfig`

The generated setup in `.editorconfig` automatically strips extra spaces at the end of lines and adds an enter at the end of the file. Indentation with spaces in most spaces. Suggested max line lengths for python&co, unlimited line lengths for markdown.

Nothing earth-shaking, just some basic sanity for all the files. See https://editorconfig.org/ .

Many editors [have build-in support](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed), for some you need a plugin, [like for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig).
