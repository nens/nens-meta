# NenS-meta: basic project configuration and automation

Basic idea:

- Use a virtualenv in a standard location and activate it.
- The tricky bits are pre-configured (vscode, pytest, formatting, etc).
- VScode should work out of the box.
- Commandline usage too.
- It works on linux, mac and windows.

Start at [](usage.md)!

:::{note}
NenS-meta is mostly intended for use within https://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl, so the defaults are those that are handy for *our* projects.
