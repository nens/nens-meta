# Changelog of nens-meta


## 0.1 (unreleased)

- Initial project structure created with cookiecutter and [cookiecutter-python-template](https://github.com/nens/cookiecutter-python-template).
- Generating an `.editorconfig` file in the target project.
- Started using a `.nens.toml` file for configuring our behaviour.
- Files can be excluded with a `leave_alone = true` setting: handy when it is heavily customised.
- Generating `.gitignore`.
- Generating `pyproject.toml`. Settings for ruff, zest.releaser, pytest, coverage and vscode.
- Renaming files that aren't needed anymore, such as `setup.py` :-)
